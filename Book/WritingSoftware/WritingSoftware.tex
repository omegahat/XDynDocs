\chapter{Writing Software: Turning Code into Software}

In this chapter, we explore the transition from writing individual
commands, scripts and functions for your own use to writing software
that you can use in different projects or that others can use.

This chapter introduces numerous ideas and software.  It is intended
primarily for graduate students, at the PhD or Master's level.
