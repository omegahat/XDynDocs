Does this mean there are more questions than answers up to a certain point in time?
What other considerations do we have to take into account?

Can you identify threads, i.e. groups of messages
that are in reply to each other. The subject line may provide a clue
but not be good enough by itself. The Message-ID and the References fields
should go a long way.

What is the distribution of initial response time to a question?
For how long do discussions related to a particular question go on?
You may want to ungroup the messages by month so that you can deal with
transition across the file boundaries, i.e. messages posted
on the last day of one month and answered on the next day, i.e.
at the beginning of the next month.

This is a convenient approach and very fast.
This doesn't guarantee the first match.
</p><div xmlns=""><pre class="rcode">
refs = references[!is.na(references)]
reply = match(names(allMsgs)[is.question], refs)
sum(is.na(reply))
sum(is.na(reply))/sum(is.question)  # 57%
replyTo = which(!is.na(references))[reply]
</pre></div>
<p>
So over 50% of the questions didn't get a response.
Does this mean we need to rethink what it means to be a question and a response,
i.e. our computations?
A major part of reading text data is trying to learn the format as we go,
expanding or constraining our text patterns to build rules that capture more
of the structure that we uncover empirically.
</p><p>
</p><div xmlns=""><pre class="rcode">
allMsgs = structure(unlist(msgs, recursive = FALSE), 
                     names = unlist(lapply(msgs, names)))

references = sapply(allMsgs, function(x) x$header["References"])
is.question = rep(FALSE, length(allMsgs))
is.question[is.na(references)] = TRUE
sum(is.question)
</pre></div>
<p>
</p><div xmlns=""><pre class="rcode">
idx = which(is.question)
first.reply = sapply(idx, function(i) {
                            id = names(allMsgs)[i]
                              # Can be a lot smarter about this since we know it is likely to be within 
                              # a few minutes, hours or days. Perhaps loop, starting at the index of the message
                              # and breaking when we find the match.
                            which.min(id == references)
                          } )

                               if(references[k] == id)
                                 return(k)

Maybe not all messages that are really in reply to another have a References.
So we have to look at the body as  well.
When is the earliest message with a References field in the header.

min(which(!is.na(references)))

Identify R functions being mentioned in a message.  Look for
"foo()" and "foo(a, b, c....)"  Also compare the words (before
stemming) in the body and subject to the variables in the R search
path.  Can you identify package names in the text and add the
variables from those packages?

Can we "cluster" the messages by topic?
Do we want to do this by message or by thread?
Does these change over time?
To analyze the text of the message, you will
want to remove common "stop" words
and stem words so that, for example,
stop, stopped and stopping all map to stop.

Can we identify the code elements within the body of a message.
This is made more complicated because of the &lt;

as the prompt  for R.
