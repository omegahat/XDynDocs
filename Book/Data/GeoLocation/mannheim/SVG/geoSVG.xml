<title>Starplots</title>

What do we need.  We'll draw a star plot at each (x, y) location with
axes for each orientation and signal scaled from -99 being 0 and -25
being the maximum.  We want to scale the starplots so as to be able to
differentiate aggregate signal for that. Perhaps we want to use the
top 2 or 3 orientation - base station signals.  Then we want to pick a
maximum and minimum radius and use the aggregate signal scaled
between these. We can do all these computations in R
and then export information that Javascript can use to draw the
starplot as the mouse moves over the points.
