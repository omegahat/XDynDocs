In this study, the idea of nearest neighbor is 
reasonably simple to articulate.
For a given observation,
we have an orientation
and  collection triples of 
(mac, channel and signal)
values.
We actually have many of these, approximately 110.
The orientation applies to all of these measures.
What we do next is to find out how
close this observation is to each of the
reference/training observations.
