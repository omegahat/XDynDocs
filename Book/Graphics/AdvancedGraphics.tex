\chapter{Advanced Graphics}

\begin{summary}
  In this chapter, we focus on more advanced aspects of graphics
  within R and also look at creating graphics that can be displaed in
  other aplications such as Google Earth and also deployed on the Web
  and provide animation and interactivity.  The purpose is to show the
  reader how to create their own complex plots and also to illustrate
  that visualization is a vital field that is much broader and more
  modern than traditional statistical graphics.
