This example is inspired by an example on the Franz Lisp web site
illustrating how to access and work with earthquake data.  What we
want to do is is fetch the data from the USGS (or any other site such
as www.data.scec.org) and then look at the statistical characteristics
of this data.  Then we want to display this data on maps.  These will
involve static maps using R's graphics facilities and also dynamic
graphics using Google Earth.  The data are available in CSV and also
XML formats.  There are RSS feeds as well as more complete XML
formats.  Of course, the CVS format is simple to work with in R since
there is direct support.  Creating XML for Google Earth will require
knowledge of the XML format used by GE.

We might also look at the populations affected by an earthquake.  This
would involve resolving locations with city names and then population
information from, e.g., census data.  This is the merging across
several different data sources.

We also might want to look at some characteristics over time.
And also look at the frequency of different magnitudes.

USGS provides KMZ files. We want to add to these with "meta-data".
