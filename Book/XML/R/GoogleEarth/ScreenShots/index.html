<h1>R and Google Earth</h1>

This is a simple example of using R to create input for Google Earth.
We are not concerning ourselves here with the best way to display the
data at this point. Rather we are exercising the mechanism for
generating KML from data in R so that we can display information on
Google Earth.

<p/>
You can load this into Google Earth by clicking on
<a href="CityTemperatures.kmz">this link</a>.
Alternatively, you can look at <a href="ScreenShots/">some screen shots</a>


<p/>

The data are temperature measurements for each of 100 cities in the US
taken in each of January, April, July and October.  So, for each city
we have a time series, and for any of these 4 times, we have a picture
of the distribution of temperature across the US geographically.

<p/>
By displaying the information in Google Earth, we get
different forms of interactivity relatively easily.
A user can click on a point and get an HTML document to appear in a
popup "bubble" window.
The user can zoom in and out and see the big picture or individual
cities.
We could setup an animation so that we can see how the temperature
varies over time dynamically rather than looking at the different
time series.

<p/>
For better or worse, we will do something reasonably obvious
but not necessarily visually effective.
<ul class="list">
  <li> At each city, we will display a small picture of the time series
of the temperature for that city.
  <li>We color the lines connecting the points to illustrate
whether it was cold, warm, hot or very hot.
  <li> A legend in the lower-left corner of the screen maps the colors to
values.
  <li> Each city has a thumb-tac which a user can click on to
       pull up a window giving a more detailed display of the
       time series with an axis and also a table listing the actual
      values.
  <li> If the Google Earth time window is widened to include two or
      more months, clicking on the thumb-tac illustrates all of the
      points within that time period for that city by placing
      them on spokes eminating from the thumb-tac.
</ul>

<p/>

We can see 
<ul class="list">
  <li> there is little variation in weather, e.g. California (especially San Francisco), Hawaii
        but that Hawaii is very warm all year round, whereas
      California   is cooler in the early part of the year;
     
  <li> that the mid-west is very cold in the winter and hot in the summer;
  <li> Alaska has quite a bit of variation, but is cooler than the
     rest of the country;
  <li> the south-east part of the country is noticeably warmer;
  <li> the Rocky mountains don't seem to be very different from the
   flat mid-west. Is this because the cities in the Rockies are not at
   very high elevations;
  <li> Lake Superior keeps Duluth cooler in the hot periods than other cities nearby,
    but this is not true for Lake Michigan's effect on Milwakee and Chicago on the other lake.
</ul>

We also notice that Grand Rapids, Michigan is mis-located,
especially if we have the borders displayed on Google Earth.
The latitude was intentionally altered in this data.

<p/>

A <a href="xyplot.jpg">lattice/trellis plot</a> of couse shows this information also,
but we don't get the  layout of the panels corresponding
to the geographical positions of the cities.
Of course, we should improve it to use the same coloring scheme for
the lines as we use in our plots, and arrange the panels by
latitude to show the effect of the increasingly northern latitude.

<p/>

<h2>The Code</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> <a href="cityTemperatures.R">Code to generate XML</a>
  <dd> This creates the KML document in R and the serializes it to a file.

  <dt>
  <li> <a href="images.R">Code to generate images</a>
  <dd>
      This is done once, not each time we generate the XML,
      so
<pre>
createHist(temperature); createHist(temperature, mini = TRUE); createLegend(temperature)      
</pre>
      is the command.
</dl>

There are lots of things to cleanup
including the legend, the plots, comments in the code, etc.


<p/>
Information about how to create the KML files
is available at <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/">http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/</a>.

<h2>Future work</h2>

There are lots more interesting things
to do with this interface.

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> On Windows, we can control Google Earth directly using a DCOM
  client interface.
  <dd>
  <dt>
  <li> We can work with different example data
  <dd> For instance, earthquake information,
      animal migration.

  <dt>
  <li> Have interactive controls in R (e.g. via RGtk, RwxWidgets, RQt,
  tcltk) and have queries in R select points in a dataset and
  highlight those in Google Earth
      
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Interpolate the temperatures for time and space over all the US
      and superimpose a surface. And then allow the user to transition
      between these over time via the Google Earth time control.
  <dd>
      
</dl>

<h2>Notes</h2>
This is a fresh start, but relates to the work that Motoki
Wu did in an "Advanced Computing Topics" class in Davis in 2007.
