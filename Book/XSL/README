Using db2latex to convert docbook markup to LaTeX.

http://db2latex.sourceforge.net/

----------

The db2latex distribution doesn't run in xsltproc
without first editing the file
 xsl/common/common.xsl

Change the name of the template 

  <xsl:template name="question.answer.label">

at line (approx.) 359 by preceeding the question.answer.label
with some arbitrary string, e.g. "DUNCANquestion.answer.label"


---------

Put 

 <rewriteURI uriStartString="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/db2latex/release/xsl/" rewritePrefix="/Users/duncan/db2latex-xsl-0.8pre1/xsl/"/>

into the catalog.xml file that is referenced by the XML_CATALOG_FILES environment variables which is used by
xsltproc to find files locally.
