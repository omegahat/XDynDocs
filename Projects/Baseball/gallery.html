These are examples of some slightly more complicated plots. They are
not necessarily "good" plots, just examples to help give you a sense
of what you might do and how you might do it.

<h2>Team Payroll for Years</h2>

Data:
<pre>
 d = dbGetQuery(con,
       "SELECT Salaries.yearID AS Year,
               Teams.name AS Team,
               SUM(Salaries.salary) AS Payroll,
               Teams.lgID AS League
        FROM Master, Teams, Salaries
        WHERE
             Salaries.yearID = Teams.yearID
           AND
             Master.playerID = Salaries.playerID
           AND Teams.teamID = Salaries.teamID
        GROUP BY Team, Year
        ORDER BY Team, Year;")
</pre>

Time series plot for payroll for each team
witht a  boxplot for each year showing the distribution
of the total payrolls for the collection of
teams.

S code (approximately)
<pre>
boxplot(Payroll ~ Year, data = d,at = 1985:2003, add = TRUE, col="red", lwd=2, notch = TRUE)
plot(0, xlim = range(d[,"Year"]), ylim = range(d[,"Payroll"]), type = "n", ..., xlab = xlab, ylab = ylab)

A trellis/lattice-based boxplot of payroll versus year for each
division with each of the two leagues (American and National)
