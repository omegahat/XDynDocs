<h1>Field Descriptions for TCP connections  Attributes</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Field name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
  <tr>
<td>conn</td>
<td>Unique identifier for each connection in the relation.</td>
</tr>

  <tr>
<td>host_a</td>
<td>The IP address of the a machine involved in the
	connection. This is usually the machine that initiated the connection.
        </td>
</tr>

  <tr>
<td>host_b</td>
<td>The IP address of the 'b' machine in the connection.
         This is usually the machine that was contacted by the 
         host a machine.
        </td>
</tr>

  <tr>
<td>port_a</td>
<td>The port number used by the application on the a host
	machine for this connection. Port numbers can be associated
        with services and applications by relating them to the
	Services table in the database.
         If this is a low number (e.g. less than 1024), it corresponds
        to a well-known service. This is more likely to be the case
        for the port_b field below as clients connect to servers 
        on their well known ports.
          </td>
</tr>

  <tr>
<td>port_b</td>
<td>The port number for the b host machine in the
	connection. If this is a server machine, the port will
        indicate what the application is that created the connection.
        This is found by relating the port number to the Services table.
