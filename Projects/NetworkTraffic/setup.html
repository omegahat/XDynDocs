Labs intrustion detection simulation from 1999</a>.  
We used most of the inside tcpdump training and test data from the five
weeks. (For reasons that are not yet clear,
processing the tcpdump data for
week1 thursday
week3 friday
week4 tuesday

caused the tcptrace program to "get stuck".
)

<p></p>

There are currently four tables in the Network database on
winnie.ucdavis.edu.  The login is bob and the is no password needed.
As a result, the privileges are very limited for this user.  All that
bob can do is issue SELECT commands in SQL (and a few simple commands
such as DESCRIBE and USE).  

<p></p>

At present, we don't have information at the packet level.

<p></p> The four tables are TCPConnections, OutsideTCPConnections,
Services and HostInfo.  These give information about Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP) connections between pairs of machines on a
network.  The network is divided into two pieces - the inside and the
outside.  The TCPConnections relation has records on all the TCP
connections from within the given network.  The OutsideTCPConnections
has records on TCP connections from between the inside and the outside
network.  The Services table provides information about the different
ports on a machine that are used by different applications.  For
example, it lists 25 as being for SMTP, the Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol; port 80 for HTTP, the HyperText Transfer Protocol used for
HTML pages and Web browser; port 22 for ssh, the Secure shell for
logging into machines; and so on.  This table allows you to connect
the ports in TCPConnections and OutsideTCPConnections to actual
applications/services such as HTTP, FTP, SSH, mail, and so on.  The
final table is HostInfo and this provides information about some IP
addresses in the TCP connections tuples.  The information gives the
names, what operating system they are running, and whether they are
machines on the inside or outside network or a hub or router device.

<p></p>
You can use the SQL command
<table xmlns:r="http://www.r-project.org" xmlns:s="http://cm.bell-labs.com/stat/S4" xmlns:c="http://www.c.org" xmlns:python="http://www.python.org" xmlns:perl="http://www.perl.org" xmlns:vb="http://www.visualbasic.com" xmlns:omegahat="http://www.omegahat.org" xmlns:bioc="http://www.bioconductor.org" xmlns:java="http://www.java.com" xmlns:statdocs="http://www.statdocs.org" xmlns:gtk="http://www.gtk.org" xmlns:com="http://www.microsoft.com" border="0"><tr align="left"><th><pre class="sql">
 DESCRIBE <span class="emphasis"><em>table name</em></span>
</pre></th></tr></table>
to get information about the attributes about any of these tables.


<p></p>

There is a <a href="schema.html" target="_top">description of the fields</a>
in the TCPConnections and OutsideTCPConnections

</div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2579480"></a>Creating the Data</h2></div></div><div></div></div>

The TCP connection data come from the Lincoln Labs Network Intrusion
simulation project.  We focus on the TCP trace information in this
simulation.  We have 5 weeks of data (three training and two test
weeks), and we have TCP packet traces for both inter and intra network
(outside and inside) for each day from Monday to Friday.  These traces
are gathered using the <b>tcpdump</b> tool which
monitors all TCP and UDP packets on a particular interface,
e.g. ethernet card.  This creates a binary file containing all the
information about the different packets.

<p></p> 

Our first task is to transform this information into records
describing each TCP connection.  In other words, we have to gather the
packets involved in each connection and then compute some derived
variables describing that connection.  Fortunately, we don't have to
do program these computations.  Instead, we can use the
<b>tcptrace</b> program to do this.  This collects
the packets and gives us information about the individual connections.
It reports information such as the IP addresses of the two machines,
the port numbers, the time of the first and last packet, the number of
bytes, the number of packets, the number of ACKnowledgements and
SYNchronize packets, different information about the window size used,
and so on.  And it gives us this information separately for both hosts
involved in the connection.

<p></p>

We can have tcptrace output the information for each
connection in a TAb-delimited format using the --tsv flag.
So we can invoke it as
<table xmlns:r="http://www.r-project.org" xmlns:s="http://cm.bell-labs.com/stat/S4" xmlns:c="http://www.c.org" xmlns:python="http://www.python.org" xmlns:perl="http://www.perl.org" xmlns:vb="http://www.visualbasic.com" xmlns:omegahat="http://www.omegahat.org" xmlns:bioc="http://www.bioconductor.org" xmlns:java="http://www.java.com" xmlns:statdocs="http://www.statdocs.org" xmlns:gtk="http://www.gtk.org" xmlns:com="http://www.microsoft.com" border="0"><tr align="left"><th><pre class="sql">
tcptrace -ln --tsv tcpdump.file
</pre></th></tr></table>
to get the full or long output with no 
name resolution on the IP addresses and in 
TAB-delimited format.

<p></p> There are several difficulties with this when we try to read
this into a database.  Firstly, there are several fields that are
given as n/m where n and m are counts.  We need to separate these into
two variables for the database.  Also, we have values that are output
as Y and N for Yes and No.  We need to turn these into 1 and 0 for
BOOLEAN values in the database.  And we need to convert NAs to \N to
represent NULLs in the input for the MySQL database.
We can deal with these by filtering each output line
and transforming the relevant pieces.

<p></p>

An even more problematic issue is the fact that we have to handle the
connection identifier numbers across different files.  We have tcpdump
data for each day in separate files.  When tcptrace processes a file,
it starts the connection numbers anew. So we would end up with
duplicates.  We can chose to omit the connection number when loading
the data, but this can be slightly problematic.  Alternatively, we can
make the numbers consecutive across files.

<p></p>

We can do all of these with a simple filter that takes in each line of
output from tcptrace and transforms it appropriately.  When one
tcpdump input file is finished, we can continue the connection number
count to the start of the next file reasonably easily.  A Perl script
could be used to do all these transformations.  Because we may also
need to transform the way packets are processed, we chose to modify
the tcptrace code itself to create the appropriate output.  This is
rarely a good thing to do, namely modify an application with a
standard distribution. We could write a module for tcptrace.  But
instead we modify the source directly due to lack of time, not because
it is a good thing to do!.
</div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2579428"></a>getTcp: Downloading the tcpdump files</h2></div></div><div></div></div>
We download the different tcpdump input files using the (Bourne) shell
script <a href="getTcp" target="_top">getTcp</a>.  This automates the
downloads of the files for the different weeks and days for which we
have data from Lincoln Labs.  It places each file in the local
directory giving each name of the form
week<span class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span>-day-inside.tcpdump.gz.

<p></p>
The script also allows us to reasonably easily fetch other data such as that for the
outside network, and that for the test weeks.  Note that we need to
exclude some of the files since our (modified) tcptrace was having
difficulties with them and simply "hanging".  We need to investigate
this more.
</div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2579581"></a>process: Processing packets into connections for the
database.</h2></div></div><div></div></div> We use the (Bourne) shell script <a href="process" target="_top">process</a> to loop over the different tcpdump.gz
files for each week and each day of the week.  This invokes
<b>tcptrace</b> for each of these TCP trace files
and stores the TAB-delimited output in a corresponding weeki-day.sql
file containing the connections processed by tcptrace.  These files
can be loaded into the table in our database.  This output file is in
TAB-delimited form with NAs specified as \N for MySQL, and with the
different fields of the form Y or N and a/b where a and b are booleans
or counts separated and replaced with 1 and 0 for the booleans.  The
modified version of tcptrace-6.6.1 is available.


<p></p> As we loop over these files, we have to ensure that the
connection numbers are different for each day so that we can use the
connection number attribute (<b xmlns:sql="http://www.sql.org" class="sqlAttributeName">conn</b>) as a
<span class="emphasis"><em>primary key</em></span> in our table/relation.
<b>tcptrace</b> starts from 1 each time and this
will cause duplicate values in the primary key.  So, we modified the
tcptrace code to allow the starting connection number to be specified
on the command line.  We use -k as the command line flag for
specifying the starting connection number to
<b>tcptrace</b>.  This was the immediately available
flag remaining.  We specify it as -k10 to start at the TCP connection
number output at 10.

<p></p> Armed with this minor modification to
<b>tcptrace</b>, the <a href="process" target="_top">process</a> command takes care of keeping the
running total of connection numbers and starting each invocation of
<b>tcptrace</b> with the appropriate starting value.
The script computes the next number at which to start by looking at
the <span class="emphasis"><em>last</em></span> record in the most recently processed
file.  For example, if we have have just processed the file
week2-tuesday-tcpdump.gz, we would look in the resulting
week2-tuesday.sql file and get the last record.  If we used a (Perl)
filter to modify each record to rewrite the NULL values, etc., we
could simply output the connection number of the last processed
connection in each file as the return value.  But there are two
problems with this.  Firstly, we are (for better or worse) doing the
rewriting in <b>tcptrace</b> so we don't have a
filter. Secondly, the connection number may not fit in the data type
returned from an application.  We may end up with a very large number
of connections and the resulting number may be truncated or "botched"
on some systems. As a result of these two issues, in our approach, it
is simplest to fetch the last line of the tile of the most recently
created .sql file and grab the first field.
The call
<table xmlns:r="http://www.r-project.org" xmlns:s="http://cm.bell-labs.com/stat/S4" xmlns:c="http://www.c.org" xmlns:python="http://www.python.org" xmlns:perl="http://www.perl.org" xmlns:vb="http://www.visualbasic.com" xmlns:omegahat="http://www.omegahat.org" xmlns:bioc="http://www.bioconductor.org" xmlns:java="http://www.java.com" xmlns:statdocs="http://www.statdocs.org" xmlns:gtk="http://www.gtk.org" xmlns:com="http://www.microsoft.com" border="0"><tr align="left"><th><pre class="sql">
tail -n 1 $w-$d.sql | perl -ne 'm/^([0-9]+)/ ; print $1,"\n";
</pre></th></tr></table>
does this by feeding the last line of the file to Perl and having it
fetch the first field via a regular expression and printing it to the
regular standard output.  We store this in a file so that if the
processing of a given tcpdump file fails, we can continue on with the
next one.  We should avoid using this temporary and intermediate file
conId and it is easy to do this in retrospect.

<p></p>
Rather than using Perl here, we could also use
the Unix tool
<b>cut</b>:
<table xmlns:r="http://www.r-project.org" xmlns:s="http://cm.bell-labs.com/stat/S4" xmlns:c="http://www.c.org" xmlns:python="http://www.python.org" xmlns:perl="http://www.perl.org" xmlns:vb="http://www.visualbasic.com" xmlns:omegahat="http://www.omegahat.org" xmlns:bioc="http://www.bioconductor.org" xmlns:java="http://www.java.com" xmlns:statdocs="http://www.statdocs.org" xmlns:gtk="http://www.gtk.org" xmlns:com="http://www.microsoft.com" border="0"><tr align="left"><th><pre class="sql">
tail -n 1 $w-$d.sql | cut -f 1
</pre></th></tr></table>
For this particular application, <b>cut</b>
is apropriate. If we needed to do more,
Perl would likely be the tool of choice.

<p></p> The <a href="process" target="_top">process</a> script creates a data
file file (week-day.sql) for each TCP trace file it processes.  Each
of these can be loaded directly into an appropriately defined MySQL
table.  And <a href="process" target="_top">process</a> also writes this
command for each tcpdump file into the file named
<tt class="filename">process.sql</tt>.  This can be used to load the entire
collection of data files into the TCPConnections relations.

<p></p> 

So, after processing the input files, we have an SQL script named
process.sql which will populate a table.  We also need define the
table.  We do this via the manually generated script <a href="table.sql" target="_top">table.sql</a>.  This contains commmands to define
the SQL relation in the Network database.  One can use the interactive
<b>mysql</b> shell to execute these
two files.

We also want to get the names and descriptions of the ports and their
services into the database.  We read this from <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers" target="_top">http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers</a> and modify that
file somewhat by hand to extract only the tables, ignoring the
commentary and references.
The result is in <tt class="filename">port-table</tt>.
<p></p>

Next, we read the lines into R and split
them up into name, port number, protocol type, description.  We ignore
comment lines (starting with #), and we also discard the entries that
specify a range of ports (e.g.  the line
<div class="literallayout"><p><br>
 flex-lm         27000-27009 FLEX LM (1-10)<br>
</p></div>
)

<p></p> 

The S function <i xmlns:r="http://www.r-project.org" xmlns:s="http://cm.bell-labs.com/stat/S4" xmlns:c="http://www.c.org" xmlns:python="http://www.python.org" xmlns:perl="http://www.perl.org" xmlns:vb="http://www.visualbasic.com" xmlns:omegahat="http://www.omegahat.org" xmlns:bioc="http://www.bioconductor.org" xmlns:java="http://www.java.com" xmlns:statdocs="http://www.statdocs.org" xmlns:gtk="http://www.gtk.org" xmlns:com="http://www.microsoft.com"><a href="s:function(%22servTable%22)">servTable</a></i> in <a href="services.R" target="_top">services.R</a> processes the file
<tt class="filename">port-table</tt>.  We write the resulting matrix to a
TAB-delimited file so that it can be read into the MySQL table.
So the S script
<pre xmlns:omg="http://www.omegahat.org" xmlns:rs="http://www.omegahat.org/RS" xmlns:r="http://www.r-project.org" xmlns:s="http://cm.bell-labs.com/stat/S4" class="Scode">
 source("services.R")
 x = servTable()
 write.table(x, "port.data", sep="\t", na = "\\N", row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
</pre>
takes care of processing the <tt class="filename">port-table</tt>
file to get it into a suitable form for MySQL.

<p></p> And the file port.sql gives the SQL commands to create the
table and populate it with the values generated from R.

</div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2624503"></a>Host Information</h2></div></div><div></div></div> 

And the final table is the information about the host machines in the
networks from which we are gathering the TCP traces.  We have the
association between some of the host names and their IP address that
we see in the traces.  Using these names makes it slightly easier to
refer to them. And we also have information about which operating
system they are running, where in the network they are (e.g. inside or
outside, or a switch or hub), and some additional notes on the
machine.  We store this in a separate table,
<i xmlns:sql="http://www.sql.org" class="sqlAttributeName">HostInfo</i> and define this table in
the SQL file <a href="host.sql" target="_top">host.sql</a>.  We read the
information from the HTML file (<a href="hosts.html" target="_top">hosts.html</a>) provided by the Lincoln Labs
folks into R using the <i xmlns:r="http://www.r-project.org" xmlns:s="http://cm.bell-labs.com/stat/S4" xmlns:c="http://www.c.org" xmlns:python="http://www.python.org" xmlns:perl="http://www.perl.org" xmlns:vb="http://www.visualbasic.com" xmlns:omegahat="http://www.omegahat.org" xmlns:bioc="http://www.bioconductor.org" xmlns:java="http://www.java.com" xmlns:statdocs="http://www.statdocs.org" xmlns:gtk="http://www.gtk.org" xmlns:com="http://www.microsoft.com"><a href="s:function(%22htmlTreeParse%22)">htmlTreeParse</a></i> function
in the XML package.  We process each of the
<font class="xmlTag">&lt;td&gt;</font> nodes and store the result if
appropriate and end up with the relevant information as a list of
character vectors.  This is done in the function
<i xmlns:r="http://www.r-project.org" xmlns:s="http://cm.bell-labs.com/stat/S4" xmlns:c="http://www.c.org" xmlns:python="http://www.python.org" xmlns:perl="http://www.perl.org" xmlns:vb="http://www.visualbasic.com" xmlns:omegahat="http://www.omegahat.org" xmlns:bioc="http://www.bioconductor.org" xmlns:java="http://www.java.com" xmlns:statdocs="http://www.statdocs.org" xmlns:gtk="http://www.gtk.org" xmlns:com="http://www.microsoft.com"><a href="s:function(%22readHosts%22)">readHosts</a></i> in <a href="hosts.R" target="_top">hosts.R</a>.

<p></p> After obtaining this host record information, we have to get
it into a format suitable for MySQL and add on information about which
machine is inside, outside or a hub/router.  We do this by specifying
the groups manually and collapsing the values down to a matrix via the
function <i xmlns:r="http://www.r-project.org" xmlns:s="http://cm.bell-labs.com/stat/S4" xmlns:c="http://www.c.org" xmlns:python="http://www.python.org" xmlns:perl="http://www.perl.org" xmlns:vb="http://www.visualbasic.com" xmlns:omegahat="http://www.omegahat.org" xmlns:bioc="http://www.bioconductor.org" xmlns:java="http://www.java.com" xmlns:statdocs="http://www.statdocs.org" xmlns:gtk="http://www.gtk.org" xmlns:com="http://www.microsoft.com"><a href="s:function(%22reduce%22)">reduce</a></i>, again in <a href="hosts.R" target="_top">hosts.R</a> file.

<p></p> Again, we write the R matrix to a file that can be loaded into
MySQL.  And we define the
<i xmlns:sql="http://www.sql.org" class="sqlAttributeName">HostInfo</i> table.
The S code is
<pre xmlns:omg="http://www.omegahat.org" xmlns:rs="http://www.omegahat.org/RS" xmlns:r="http://www.r-project.org" xmlns:s="http://cm.bell-labs.com/stat/S4" class="Scode">
source("hosts.R")
write.table(reduce(), file="host.data", sep="\t", row.names= FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
</pre>
and the SQL code is given in <a href="host.sql" target="_top">host.sql</a>.

</div></div></body></html>
