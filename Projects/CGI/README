Web Server setup
----------------

Generate random numbers between 4000 and 9999
for the ports, one for each group and create a file
in the format of Ports, i.e. 
 groupi,port

Create users for s133group<i>.
Add user nobody to each of the new groups.

WebServer installs the HTTP server for each group into ~s133group<i>.

WebSetup installs the CGIwithR files into the cgi-bin/ area for each
group, creates an directory for creating images and and changes
permissions for the files.




User-level accounts
----------------------

Create a file named WebGroup.txt containing information
about which student is in which group. Each line in the file
should be of the form
          i,login,name
where i is the group number (without the group prefix, i.e. just 3)
and login is the same login they are to use to log into the machine.
This is the same as their account on the central machines.



HTPPPort is used to put a file .HTTPPort in each students
account identifying the port on which their server resides.

MakeGroupAccounts creates accounts for each student
in each group.
