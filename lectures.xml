Why Stat Computing is important?

How computers work?

Systems for computing with data:
   Matlab, SAS, S-Plus/R, Excel, SPSS. 
   Compiled versus interpreted.
     C, Java, versus S
     Scripting versus interactive
       Perl versus S

Structure of the course
  What we'll cover. 
  Philosophy and big picture and practical details.

    Basics of representing numbers in the computer and 
    


    factors, integers, reals, strings, enumerations
      Representation of numbers, etc. in the computer.
    
    Mapping raw data into computer data structures
        suitable for computations we want to perform.

    examples:  
      1 1.2 ABC
      4 1.7 CDF
          reals or integers, constraints on values/ranges, enumerated
          set
          Unknown without schema.

       time series, longitudinal, ragged arrays
       spatial data


     Memory usage: efficiency, size computations
       
     Multiple files, one or more per record transformed into records
     in the computational system 

     Processing with regular expressions, etc. into records.
