* introduction
Motivating examples that are suited to exploration using the computer
because of complexity, rapid reorganization, interactive/direct
manipulation, integration with spatial maps, customized presentations.
   
   Co-/trellis plots for interesting examples where 
   scatterplot matrices with brushing - i.e. ggobi
   maps - GIS systems (GRASS, ArcInfo) and statistics.
   customized plots - Napoleonic march, SARS.
   Colors for maps - gradients, divergent, heat maps. 
   graphs - nodes and edges

 Show them interesting examples and how good graphics really
are illuminating. And how using all of the potential of the computer
for iterating to get good plots with glyphs, colors, plot types.

Then, in the absence of determining a ``killer plot'', they 
need to know likely candidate plot types. 

Data - plot - incrementally improving a plot.
Understanding how a plot is ``deficient''.
  Grossly deficient - wrong type for representing information.
  Improve the attributes of the plot.

        color
  coordinate systems: pixels, data coordinates
  plot layout in composite plots
    par(mfrow=c( , )), layout and insets.
