<title>Introduction</title>

In the past chapter, we examined ways to process data using regular
expressions. In this context, we wrote a program or script to extract
the information we wanted from the data. It was up to us to identify
the patterns in the text files. In other words, each consumer of the
file was responsible for working out its structure and extracting the
relevant data.  In some cases, identifying patterns is very
complicated, or even impossible. Instead, we must
special case certain data or records.

What if the data was more structured and identifying patterns was
easier?  What if instead of each consumer having to identify the
patterns and guessing the structure, we encode it in the file itself.
If the data were self-describing, we would be better off.  If datasets
with the same structure adhered to a particular format, then it would
be easy to write code that read that data. And if we can describe
that format, we might
