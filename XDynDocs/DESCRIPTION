Title: Dynamic Documents with XML and XSL
Description:
  XDynDocs is a package for working with structured documents with R.
  It uses a combination of R and Docbook to allow authors to 
  create and then process documents to render them in HTML, PDF,
  FO and LaTeX. The documents can be transformed "statically"
  i.e. just rendering the current contents as the author wrote them,
  or dynamically in which case R code within the document 
  is evaluated and the results inserted into the output document.
  The infrastructure allows static processing to be done both in R
  or externally using make files.
  The processing is highly extensible as it uses XML, XSL and 
  facilities for combining R and XSL.  It is relatively straightforward
  to change how XML elements are processed within R and/or rendered.
  One can also control the rendering via an extensive collection
  of parameters that govern the XSL transformations and also the evaluation
  of R code.
  The documents we promote and can operate on are significantly  richer
  than simple linear documents (e.g. as with Sweave, odfWeave, etc.)
  They allow inclusion of many additional document elements such as 
  branches or alternative approaches, elements that are intended for different 
  readers.
  The documents can contain meta-information to make them interactive.
  The structured documents allow for additional manipulation to verify
  or augment the contents, e.g. find all references to R functions or classes or packages,
  correct misspellings of their names, add package names, etc.
  We can also generate the necessary help files for adding links to these references
  so that readers can read help interactively.
