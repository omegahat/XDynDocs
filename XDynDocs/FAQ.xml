When I install the package from source, I get errors about
'dirname -help'. Where is this coming from?
<a>
It is coming from when we compute the options for building
FO and HTML documents as  vectors of R strings.
We defer to make which, as a side effect, tries to resolve the 
local location of the omegahat XSL files on this machine.
It is in determining the value of  DYN_DOCS
that we use xmlcatalog and then try to get the directory name.
This will be fixed. But in the meantime, use a catalog
file by setting the XML_CATALOG_FILES environment variable.

When I create a latex file (using the dblatex format),
I can't run latex/pdflatex on the resulting .tex file.
I get an error message about not being able to find docbook.sty.
<a>
You need the dblatex/latex directories in your TEX search path.
Set the  environment variable TEXINPUTS to 
<sh:code>
 export TEXINPUTS= dblatex-xsl-current/latex//:${TEXINPUTS}::
</sh:code>

The <latex/> I generate refers to \XMLAttr, \XMLTag, etc.,
but these macros are not defined. Where can I find them?
