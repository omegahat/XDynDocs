<title>Uniform Random Numbers</title>

<para>
There are two sorts of uniform distributions that
we might sample from.  Selecting a single value
from set of possible values, with equal probability 
for each possible value is performed using the 
<userinput>sample</userinput> function, as shown below.
</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
> (n <- sample(1:5, 1))

[1] 3
]]></programlisting>

<para>
The <userinput>runif()</userinput> function  may be used to generate
random numbers from a continuous uniform distribution.
For example, the following code generates three random numbers 
between zero and one.
