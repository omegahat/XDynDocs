<h1>Writing Documents in XML</h1>

This is a collection of materials related to creating documents using
XML.  We write our documents such as articles, tutorials, assignments
and books in Docbook, an XML vocabulary for technical documents.
We convert these to HTML, PDF and LaTeX.
<p>
There are many benefits to using Docbook/XML in preference to other
markups (e.g. LaTeX). These include
<ul>
  <li> separating content and meaning from appearance,
  <li> targetting HTML and Web browsers which are increasingly richer
      than PDF,
  <li> synchronizing content across documents and formats and being
      able to reuse content,
  <li> being able to combine segments of different documents easily
      into another document,
  <li> being able to programmatically verify and modify structured
      documents,
  <li> using XSL templates to customize how the document is rendered
  <li> using XML tools  which we increasly use in other settings,
      e.g. Web services, scraping Web pages, reading structured data.
</ul>

<p>
We are not trying to convinvce people to abandon LaTeX for a new
toolchain.  We are merely attempting to make people aware of a
rich alternative. This is especially applicable for people just
embarking on a career and finding a good working setup and  environment.

<h2>Simple two-stage dynamic documents</h2>

We can easily make XML documents dynamic in
the sense of evaluating code contained in the document
and inserting the results into the projected view of
the document. This is like Sweave, but with a very
extensible document structure and processing engine.
(In addition to dynamic content, we can make these documents richly
interactive.)
<p>
There are two approaches to dynamic documents with XML and XSL.
<ul>
  <li> One is to process the document in one step that
converts the XML to the target format (e.g. HTML or FO or LaTeX), and
      evaluates the R code  (or other languages) via XSL rules and
      R functions as extension XSL functions

  <li> The second is to have two stages: process the XML document in R
      and evaluate the R code and insert the results, write the
      results  to  new document and then process that with the regular
      XSL conversion tools. 
</ul>

<p>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> A brief <a href="twoStageDynDocs.html">description</a> of the 2
  stage process

  <dt>
  <li> An example
  <dd>
      <ul>
	<li> <a href="basic.Rdyn">input</a>,
	<li> <a href="basic.xml">converted by R, with results</a>
	<li> <a href="basic.html">final HTML document</a>
      </ul>

  <dt>
  <li> <a href="evalNode.R">Simple R code</a> to implement the first stage
  <dd> This can then be used as
<pre class="rcode">
source("http://www.omegahat.org/XMLDocs/evalNode.R")
dynDoc("http://www.omegahat.org/XMLDocs/basic.Rdyn", "basic.xml")
</pre>      
Then you can use
<pre class="shellCode">
make -f &lt;wherever&gt;/Makefile basic.html      
</pre>
assuming you have the XSL files installed and the Makefile accessible.
