template.xsl - an empty/prototype/"template" XSL file that one can edit

dummy.xsl - a simple example XSL file for suppressing some nodes
             and writing templates for new nodes or overriding
             imported templates.




We could also add an output target of a word processing format such as
Word, KOffice, Open Office, etc.
Open Office already has readers for DocBook so we would just extend
these. 
The word processors have support for specifying ones own XSLT
processing rules.
