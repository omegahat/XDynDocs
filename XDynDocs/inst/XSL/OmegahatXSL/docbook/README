The reason for a docbook XSL directory is for transformations that
take a Docbook file an expand/alter it and return an Docbook file for
further processing.
For example, we might create a glossary or link table 
within an existing Docbook document and then allow that to be processed by HTML.

expandDB.xsl is the general XSL container to use.
