In order to use these XSL files locally from within a Web browser,
put a link to the current docbook-xsl directory (that contains the
html/ and xsl/ directories) within the OmegahatXSL/XSL/ directory.

The best way to do this is  to install the more recent docbook-xsl
files by un-tarring them into, say, docbook-xsl-1.73.2/
and then putting a symbolic link in that parent directory to this
version of the docbook distribution, e.g.

  ln -s docbook-xsl-1.73.2 docbook-current

Then, in the OmegahatXSL/XSL/ directory, create a link to
docbook-current, e.g.

  ln -s docbook-xsl  ~/OmegahatXSL/XSL 

In this way, when you install a new version of docbook using the
initial description above, you will not have to update the link in the
OmegahatXSL/XSL/ directory.
