Empty \docbooktolatexcite{} calls: \docbooktolatexcite{, }{}
See line 391.
This comes from 
<![CDATA[
<citation><biblioref linkend="bib:R"/></citation>
]]>

<para>
The running header is overlapping with the text.
<br/>
That's because I was using \usepackage{fullpage}!

<para>
Deal with svg figures, i.e. allow alternate content/formats or
converting the name of the file to a .pdf
<br/>
The replacement to .pdf is done.

hyperref conflicts.
Vague recollection it goes away if we use  an xsl:include, but can't do that
as we rename a named template and so get a duplicate error.

<para>
Use a lang attribute on the top-level element of your document,
e.g.
<![CDATA[
<article lang="en">
 ...
</article>
]]>
</para>

<para>
We need to arrange for a call to a general template just before
the \begin{document} is emitted.
We have to either take over the article template (in book-article.mod.xsl)
or edit the original db2latex file and insert a new line just before the 
<![CDATA[
  <xsl:text>}&#10;</xsl:text>
  <!-- Display  begindocument command -->
  <xsl:call-template name="before.document.begins"/>
  <xsl:call-template name="map.begin"/>
  <xsl:value-of select="$latex.maketitle"/>
]]>
</para>

<para>
The language is still a problem as we are getting 
references to Tableau.
<br/>
Of course, this is because I didn't put the 
lang="en" on the new document I was working with!
