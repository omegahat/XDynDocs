This is an example of a documentat that we want
to convert to <latex/>.
It uses, for example, its own format for mathematical
content such as
$$
 E[X] =  \int_0^\infty x f(x) dx
$$

<tex><![CDATA[
This is pure \TeX{}
which is passed through to 
latex as is $x < 2$
]]></tex>

Here we introduce some R code
<r:init>
n = 100
</r:init>

And then we generate a sample of size $n$
<r:code>
summary(rnorm(n))
</r:code>

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[l]{ll}
 Info &amp; value \\
\hline
 $n$ &amp; <r:expr>n</r:expr> \\
 date &amp; <current-date/> 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

It also uses a local macro such as \myMacro.

\section{A section} This is a regular <latex/>{} section.  So we see
that we are mixing <latex/> with \textit{DocBook}.
