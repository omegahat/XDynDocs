<p>

This is an R package for working with and processing dynamic,
reproducible documents using XML, XSL and R.  It supports Docbook
(with extensions for identifying R code and other markup elements) and
Microsoft Word 2007 documents.  The idea is that we take an XML document
containing both regular text and r:code, r:plot, r:expr, r:function
XML elements that contain R code. When transforming the document
to HTML or PDF (via FO), we evaluate the R code within
these XML elements and add the output to the resulting document.
The content is  therefore dynamically generated.
</p>

<p> This is similar to Sweave but has been around about a year before
Sweave was released.  It uses XML technologies - Docbook, XSL, XPath,
XInclude - and leads to a much richer document format which can
support hierarchical non-sequential documents.  We can easily
programmatically manipulate the documents to achieve various tasks
using XML tools.
</p>

<p>
Other packages providing similar or related facilities include:
<ul>
  <li> odfWeave
  <li> Sweave
  <li> RWordXML
</ul>

Why is this package different?  Firstly, it uses XML and XML-related
technologies such as XSL, XPath, XInclude, catalogs and so on. This is
a good thing as these are powerful, ubiqitous tools with a
well-documented, rich, flexible, extensible format that can be used by
many communities.  Docbook is used in many projects for technical
documentation, authoring books, and so on.  Word is a widely used word
processing tool that is more "convenient" for many users than LaTeX.
Open Office and odfWeave are good tools, but Word is probably more
widely used than Open Office.  odfWeave primarily uses the Sweave
syntax to identify code chunks (i.e. &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;=).  We use
styles to introduce markup.  </> <p> We use XSL to handle Docbook
format.  This provides a clear and rich means to extend and customize
the processing for different targets, e.g. HTML, FO/PDF.

There are a few features in this package  that are different from
odfWeave (but which could be added)
</p>
<p>
Somewhat tangential are the RDCOMClient, RDCOMServer, RDCOMEvents
and rcom pacakges. I'll explain why these are relevant later.

<p>
RXHelp - a Docbook XML-based format for documenting
R functions, classes, methods and data with
richer content and more flexible tools than available in the current Rd format.
