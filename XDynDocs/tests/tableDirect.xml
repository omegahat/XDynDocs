<title>Formatting an R result as a table</title>

<para>

In this example, we illustrate how to get more tailored output from R
than just a simple verbatim view of R's printed/displayed output.
When the dynamic evaluation mechanism evaluates an R expression or
calls an R function, it takes the resulting value and attempts to
convert it to XML.  By default, it returns a string which is the
result of printing the object.  However, if there is a method for the
<r:func>convert</r:func> function for that type of object and the
target format, then that will be invoked.  This can create a more
interesting and appropriate display.  It can return a string, but it
can also return an XML node which will be inserted into the document.
In this example, we show how to create a table from a data frame
</para>

<para>

We first ensure that our method for converting a data frame into an XML
node is registered:
<r:code eval="false">
setMethod("convert", c("data.frame", target = "FOTarget"), 
           function(from, opts = NULL, target, context = NULL)
              matrix2FO(from))
</r:code>
This would typically be done in an R package or with separate stand-alone code,
i.e. outside of the XML document.
</para>

<para>
Now, we continue with our XML document as we normally would and
describe an R computation.
(We add a column so that one of the columns is a character/non-numeric.)
<r:code showCode="true">
 mtcars$other = substring(rownames(mtcars), 1, 4)
 mtcars
</r:code>
</para>

<para>
Here we display the cats data set from MASS which contains  a factor.
<r:code>
library(MASS)
cats[1:10,]
</r:code>
</para>

<para>
You can run this with both FO and HTML as targets and 
</para>

<para>
Note that a trellis plot is convenient for the convert because we can
recognize the object and then open a graphics device and print it.
With regular plots, we have to explicitly open an appropriate graphics
device before evaluating the commands that create it.  This separation
and avoidance of global variables (i.e. the active graphics device) or
side-effects is useful.
