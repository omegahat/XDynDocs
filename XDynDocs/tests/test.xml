<title>Traffic flow on highways in California</title>
 <para>
Load the data
<r:init>
load("traffic.rda")
</r:init>
Then do a simple summary.
<r:code>
 summary(traffic$Occ1)
</r:code>
We use <r:func>read.csv</r:func> since the default values of the
arguments match the data format - commma separated values with column
names in the first line.
</para>
<para> Examine the relationships.
The IQR in lane 2 is <r:expr>IQR(traffic$Flow2)</r:expr> in comparison to
<r:expr>IQR(traffic$Flow3)</r:expr> for lane 3.
 </para>
 
 <para>
Consider the flows in the three lanes using time series plots. Which
lane typically serves the most traffic? 
  
<!--      <r:plot>
plot(traffic$Flow1, type = "l")
lines(traffic$Flow2, col = "blue")
lines(traffic$Flow3, col = "red")
      </r:plot>
-->
<r:code>
  mean(traffic$Flow2)
</r:code>
Lane 1 has the highest peaks however it also has the lowest troughs. 
</para>
<para> 
Consider the relationship between flow and occupancy. Plot flow
against occupancy for lane 1. In one sentence, describe the shape of
the points.
<r:code> 
length(traffic)
</r:code>
</para>
<para>
Consider using the R functions <r:func>plot</r:func>,
<r:func>boxplot</r:func>, <r:func>density</r:func>,
<r:func>hist</r:func>. Also consider using some of the arguments to
the plotting functions to improve the appearance of your plot, such as
<r:arg>ylim</r:arg> and <r:arg>xlab</r:arg>.
</para>
