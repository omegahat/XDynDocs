<title>Motivation</title>
<para>
The idea in this short document is to figure out how to use a dynamic,
reproducible document to create a single document which has content
computed on different machines.  We could use a cluster-computing
approach where we dispatch commands to different machines and get the
result of interest.  That is probably the "best" way to achieve the
goal, but requires a lot of installed software.  So instead, let's see
if we can use a more basic approach using XML/XSL and
<r:pkg>IDynDocs</r:pkg>.

<para>
The idea is this. We create an XML document which contains the
computations of interest.  We'll be very explicit for the moment and
later relax the strictness.  We are going to fill in a table with
timings for a particular computation within the document.
