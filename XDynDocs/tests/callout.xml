<para>Note the use of a URI which will be resolved by a catalog and so not necessarily come from the
  installed package. 
  However a catalog in the installed package provides a default rewrite  for this URI
  but a user can provide a different one in her own catalog file.
  This is useful when developing/debugging the code and not wanting to re-install the R package
  after each change.
